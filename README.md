# PredictorMesh
PredictorMesh is planned to use bleeding-edge machine learning technology to predict colleges most likely to get admission in, for a student.
It does that by keeping previous University scores, students' academic as well as non-academic and professional experience in mind. It gives a possible array of colleges where specific students would be most likely to land admission. In addition to that, PredictorMesh makes the University's cutoff, scholarship, fees, etc public. Students can also get help in the post/pre-admission process from other students in given forums.
